								Let me start where it all began:
								</br></br>
								My interest in technology started with my introduction to the
								Sega Mega Drive, also known as the Sega Genesis in the USA,
								and watching the coloured, animated characters run across the
								screen. At the time I had no idea how such a magical feat
								could happen, but that was the spark which initially ignited
								my curiosity.

								A Personal SWOT-Analysis is where one analyses their Strengths and

								could affect their studies. Below are the details I submitted in my

								<h2>My "Who am I" document feedback</h2>
								<h3>September 14, 2021</h3>
							</a>
						</div>
							<p>
								Back when I was initially accepted into HZ’s ITC course one request that
								the department had was we filled out a short “Who am I?” form, where we gave
								some info on our backgrounds, aspirations and if we had any previous experiences
								with coding. This was an interesting way of letting them get to know us better
								and see if and why we thought it was a good idea to continue with the course.
								After we submitted the form, we later received some feedback from one of the lecturers.
