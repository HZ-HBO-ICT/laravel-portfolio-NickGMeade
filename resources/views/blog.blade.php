            On Friday, September 10th, our both the Dutch and International ICS
            classes were split into groups so that we complete a "Company Safari",
            where we were tasked with researching various companies and create a poster
            displaying details about the following:

            Over the years I was able to try my hand at multiple coding languages to varying
            degrees. While some may not be remembered as well as others, all of these played
            their part in the development of how I view and approach tasks.

            Let me start where it all began:
            </br></br>
            My interest in technology started with my introduction to the
            Sega Mega Drive, also known as the Sega Genesis in the USA,
            and watching the coloured, animated characters run across the
            screen. At the time I had no idea how such a magical feat
            could happen, but that was the spark which initially ignited
            my curiosity.

            A Personal SWOT-Analysis is where one analyses their Strengths and
            Weaknesses, while also taking notes of Opportunities and Threats that
            could affect their studies. Below are the details I submitted in my
            “Who Am I?” document earlier this year.

            Back when I was initially accepted into HZ’s ITC course one request that
            the department had was we filled out a short “Who am I?” form, where we gave
            some info on our backgrounds, aspirations and if we had any previous experiences
            with coding. This was an interesting way of letting them get to know us better
            and see if and why we thought it was a good idea to continue with the course.
            After we submitted the form, we later received some feedback from one of the lecturers.
