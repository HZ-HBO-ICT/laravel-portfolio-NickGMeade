							<h2>My "Who am I?" document feedback</h2>
							<h3>September 14, 2021</h3>
						</div>
						<div class = "blog-content">
							<p>
								Back when I was initially accepted into HZ’s ITC course one request that the department had 
								was we filled out a short “Who am I?” form, where we gave some info on our backgrounds, 
								aspirations and if we had any previous experiences with coding. This was an interesting way of 
								letting them get to know us better and see if and why we thought it was a good idea to continue 
								with the course. After we submitted the form, we later received some feedback from one of the lecturers.
								</br></br>
								Compared to many of the students in the class, I came from a background where I was employed as a 
								Client Support Agent (think Customer Service but with a fancier name) at an IT company for 5 years 
								and I was also in the middle of completing a 1 year software development course, which focused on the 
								introduction to coding, basics of architecture in the IT field as well as developing some soft skills 
								(mainly for helping those fresh out of school or returning to the professional environment). Another thing
								that I was bringing to the course was the fact that at the time of applying I recently turned 31 and would 
								be entering into a college course consisting of students in their late teenage years, into their early 20s.
								</br></br>
								This was one of their main surprise points and an area of focus for when it came to my form being reviewed. 
								While my application and inclusion into ICT was welcomed and warmly received, one topic raised was if would 
								see it as a challenge having to incorporate myself into a much younger group and if I would find any other 
								challenges to my study focus and motivation.
								</br></br>
								When I first had a go at third level education (aka college education) back home in Ireland, all the way back in 2008,
								one thing which was strange, but not unknown, to me was the concept of adult learners. This basically means anyone who’s 
								at least 25 years old and returning to full time education from a wide range of backgrounds (employment, unemployment or 
								even from moving between different levels of education and courses). Many people have the natural assumption that anyone 
								going to college would be in the 18 to mid-20s range, and adult learners being towards to top end of that range. 
								However, one thing which they soon discover is that a student can be almost any age, so long as they feel like they are 
								able to learn and are willing to put the work in. Since those days I was fortunate to make many friends ranging from those 
								close to my own age up to others who were in the same position which I have placed myself into now.
							</p>

								<img src="../resources/images/adult-learner.gif" alt="How do you, fellow kids?">
								For many students at HZ, I was very lucky to receive a warm welcome from many of the students, who were both surprised at 
								my age (most people don’t believe I’m 31, even back at home) as well as congratulating my on making such a move, especially 
								combing it with leaving my existing career and moving to a completely new environment (which would be similar to many of their 
								own experiences to a degree). Also, in the years since many of the communities I am involved with, as well as those who I worked 
								and studied with branches far into both directions. 
								</br></br>
								There are of course a minority of people who I have been introduced to who had an opposite reaction, but they were not too 
								negative and was more their surprise at speaking casually with someone who is almost double their age than simply myself being “old”. 
								But that is something still prevalent in society since before even I initially started college back in 2008, as it was once believed 
								that you go to school, get a college degree and then your life‘s path is determined. While going into that topic is something for 
								another day, I would say that I believe that idea is no longer a true representation of life after school and we always have an 
								opportunity to either restart from step one all over again, or even divert to a new path whenever it suits ourselves.
								</br></br>
								Regarding my study focus, it will be a challenge to change back from a schedule where I worked during the night and going to 
								sleep at 7:00 in the morning, into one where I must be in class for 9:00 was a challenge, but I had the summer to help offset 
								that (the odd late night aside). I was also fortunate enough to have completed a full-time course last year, which consisted of 
								a 9:00 to 16:00 schedule 3 days a week, albeit all online instead of an offline course due to the pandemic. 
								Rebuilding a structure around college and allocating dedicated time to studying and/or project work is an aim of mine and it 
								can only be developed upon with further practice, which this course does offer in it’s allocated “self-study” time, which in turn 
								I can look at incorporating into my out-of-college hours as I progress.
								</br></br>
								Even though it is still early into the college year, I have been fortunate to have many positive encounters and have already made 
								many friends both inside and outside of the ICT course, we’ll see how those change as time goes on, or once we all start panicking 
								ahead of our quarterly exams… (I joke!)
