							<h2>Why did I choose ICT at HZ?</h2>
							<h3>September 14, 2021</h3>
						</div>
						<p>
							<b>Let me start where it all began:</b>
							</br></br>
							My interest in technology started with my introduction to the
							Sega Mega Drive, also known as the Sega Genesis in the USA,
							and watching the coloured, animated characters run across the
							screen. At the time I had no idea how such a magical feat
							could happen, but that was the spark which initially ignited
							my curiosity.
							</br></br>
							As life went on, and paths changed in unexpected ways, I was
							fortunate to have many encounters with different computers
							and during my teenage years I had my first coding experience
							by learning to code C++ as a part of a youth initiative
							scheme called Munster Programming Training. While I was only
							able to create a few basic programs at the time, learning
							the thought processes behind coding a program intrigued me
							and it was something that I carried with me ever since. In
							later years, this encouraged me to try additional coding
							courses in various languages before making the decision to
							return to full-time education in 2020, where I could further
							develop on my skills and analytical mindset.
							</br>
							<br>
							But as for why I decided to jump into the ICT field. Ever
							since I started working, I was always looking at ways to make
							work more efficient, e.g., where a process was being
							completed in 10 steps, I would see if it could be done in 7
							and still give the same, or better results.
							</br></br>
							Although these only started in the form of updating excel
							reports or unused features in the system software, when I
							later moved to working as a Client Support Agent for an IT
							company, the company was always open to suggestions and
							feedback regarding the team’s reporting software.
							</br></br>
							Through this, I was able to see the more technical work
							involved in how reports were generated and by conversing
							with members of the IT teams I figured out some tips and
							tricks to further expand on the search parameters, which
							helped the team immediately discover and solve more customer
							issues without having to create a support ticket and waiting
							for minutes, to hours, to days before receiving a response
							for the customer. As I became more accustomed with the
							systems, part of my role evolved into training new staff and
							team managers in how to work some of the systems, out of
							which came an opportunity to study a Training &#38 Development
							course, for occupational training, that I completed back in 2019.
							</br></br>
							As time went on, my interest turned towards more analytical fields
							grew, and I made the decision to apply for a newly offered 1-year
							course in that field in early 2020. Unfortunately, that course never
							went ahead, due to the state of global affairs, but back when I first
							applied for the course, I was introduced to the course director for
							their Software Development course, after hearing about my past
							experiences. It was thanks to that encounter that I was fortunate to
							receive an offer to transfer from the now cancelled Data Analysis
							course to Software Development 2 weeks before the college year started.
							</br></br>
							<b>That brings us to how I found HZ and why I took the leap overseas to study there:</b>
							</br></br>
							During my studies, one of our assignments for Personal &#38 Professional
							Development was to research progression opportunities after graduation, which
							included both educational and employment routes. As I was familiar with the
							available educational opportunities within Ireland, I decided to look
							overseas and came across HZ as one of the courses of interest. After further
							research, the practical nature of the ICT course in HZ seemed to suit my
							learning style and the course allows for me to try various sectors before
							deciding on which direction I want to go, be it Software, Data or Business
							IT related.
							</br></br>
							In addition to this, I do think that using the opportunity to study in a
							different country and environment would be beneficial to both my personal
							and professional development, by allowing me to push my current boundaries.
							</br></br>
							So now the first step has been taken, where is the destination?
							</br></br>
							From all that you’ve read above, I would like to progress further in an IT
							related career, be it in an Analysis or Business IT related role (although
							I am aware that the latter isn’t fully available for international students
							at this time). This is mainly due to what I perceive to be my analytical
							approach to how I helped customers in my previous careers combined with what
							I studied in my Software Development course. While looking at progression
							opportunities I did come across a Customer Experience position at Riot Games,
							which was a team who was an intermediary between the Player Support and IT
							teams that reviewed cases and determined if systems need updating, or if new
							systems were required from the IT teams. Following that they would work with
							the Player Support teams in arranging or providing training in the new
							developments, which also ties into my Training &#38 Development course.
							</br></br>
							Over the next 4 years, all remains to be seen is whether I continue down
							this same path or if additional opportunities appear before me. The world of
							ICT is ever expanding and who knows what else it creates in the future.
